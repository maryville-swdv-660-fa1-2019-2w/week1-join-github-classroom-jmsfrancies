-- This application was built on a windows 10 64 bit system.

-- The application has a long load time and I would suggest clicking on the terminal and type the number one (1), but the two jokes are worth it.

-- The two modules (colorama and graphics) were downloaded straight from github.

-- I hope that the pipfile meets expectations!
